# Systems-Project-01
Shell project

by Anthony Hom and William Hong

Features: 
	Executes single commands while removing white space
	Parses through multiple commands in a line and counts individual inputs
	Implements redirection using < and > 


Attempted: 
	Originally tried to implement pipes, but didn't account for errno. 

Bugs:
	Running two commands in one line is not working. Only the first command is run, ignoring the second command, and exiting.
